*   From the "Not Normal: the uncertainties of scientific measurements" [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00778):
    *   For the ambitious, create a 'toy monte carlo' of the sample and pair distributions for the nuclear physics data in Sec. 2.A. For simplicity assume that all the 'quantities' are gaussian distributed.
    *   Write functions where you can produce multiple gaussian distributions to sample from and generate a sample of "12380 measurements, 1437 quantities, 66677 pairs".
    *   Produce the z-distribution (using Eq. 4) plot for just your toy Monte Carlo and see if it matches a gaussian, exponential, student-t distribution, etc...

**The Boosted Decision Trees**

*   [Lecture 10](Slides/Lecture10_MVA.pdf)
*   Data
    *   Exercise 1 ([training signal](data/BDT_signal_train.txt), [training background](data/BDT_background_train.txt), [testing signal](data/BDT_signal_test.txt), [testing background](data/BDT_background_test.txt))
    *   Exercise 2 (16 variable [file](data/BDT_16var.txt))
        *   The first column is the index, hence there are 17 'variables', but the index variable only for book keeping and has no impact on whether an event is signal or background.
        *   Every even row is the 'signal' and every odd row is the 'background'. Thus, there are two rows for each index in the first column: the first is the signal and the second is the background. [Format is odd, but I got it from a colleague].
    *   Here is the solution data sets separated into two files ([benign](data/benign_true.txt) and [malignant](data/malignant_true.txt)) for the last exercise of the lecture. Here is also the [(python) code](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2017/Exam2_Problem_BDT_CheckSolutions_2016.py) that I used to establish the efficiency for all the submissions from all the students
